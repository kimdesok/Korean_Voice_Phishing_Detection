# AI-based_Korean_Voice_Phishing_Detection
## Detection of Voice Phishing in Korean
Several machine learning and deep learning methods were developed to classify texts in Korean involved with voice phishing [1][2].
This repository is organized as below:
- **Attention** : contains source codes for investigating mostly an attention-based detection model
- **Data_Collection_Preprocessing** : contains source codes for preprocessing raw data and create the datasets 
- **KoBERT** : contains source codes for implementing a KoBERT detection model
- **ML_DL_models** : contains  source codes for implementing a shadow ML and DL models
